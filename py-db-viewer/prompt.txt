   - Defines a class handling basic db operations (SQLLite file load, file save, file save as new file).  
   - Define a class for navigating, editing, viewing the loaded file - to be used by gui_components

4. gui_components.py  
   - Creates and configures GUI widgets - the widgets use methods defined in db_processing.py:  
     - A listbox showing the current 10 lines.
